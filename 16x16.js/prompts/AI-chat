What sounds should we include in our experimental drum sequencer?

We could add a variety of sounds to our experimental drum sequencer, including different percussion instruments, synth sounds, and even vocal samples.

What kind of vocal sounds are there that we can use?

There are a variety of vocal sounds that we could use, including screams, whispers, moans, and even laughter.

Could we sequence words from phonemes?

Yes, we could sequence words from phonemes, which would give the drum sequencer a more human feel.

Should we also change the rhythmic timing to give it a more human feel?

Yes, we should also change the rhythmic timing to give it a more human feel. This would make the drum sequencer more expressive and allow for more complex rhythms.

What other ways are there of changing the timing?

We could also use swing or humanize functions to change the timing.

Is setting a grid of 16 steps wide and 16 steps high too constrictive?

No, setting a grid of 16 steps wide and 16 steps high is not too constrictive. This would give us a good amount of flexibility when it comes to sequencing our drums.

Perhaps you could help us by listing some different types of rhythms we could use in our design?

There are many different types of rhythms that we could use in our design, including simple 4/4, 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8 time signatures, as well as more complex polyrhythms.

Tell us more about how we could use polyrhythms in the sequencer.

Polyrhythms are rhythms that have more than one pulse, or beat, running through them. This can create a very complex and interesting sound.
