abandon normal instruments
abandon normal sequencers
accept advice
a line has two sides
are there sections? consider transitions
ask people to work against their better judgment
assemble some of the instruments in a group and treat the group as one
balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle
breathe more deeply
cascades of sound
change instrument roles
change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency
cluster analysis
consider different fading systems
convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element
cut a vital connection
define an area as `safe' and use it as an anchor
destroy, nothing, the most important thing
discover the recipes you are using and abandon them
do nothing for as long as possible
don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do
don't be frightened of cliches
don't be frightened to display your talents
don't break the silence
don't stress one thing more than another
do something boring
do the words need changing?
do we need holes?
emphasize differences
emphasize repetitions
emphasize the flaws
faced with a choice, do both
feedback recordings into an acoustic situation
fill every beat with something
ghost echoes
give the game away
give way to your worst impulse
go slowly all the way round the outside
honor thy error as a hidden intention
how would you have done it?
humanize something free of error
imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar
imagine the music as a set of disconnected events
infinitesimal gradations
into the impossible
is there something missing?
is the tuning appropriate?
just carry on
left channel, right channel, center channel
listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly
listen to the quiet voice
look at a very small object; look at its center
look at the order in which you do things
look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them
make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame
make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last
make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action; incorporate
mechanicalize something idiosyncratic
mute and continue
only one element of each kind
(organic) machinery
overtly resist change
put in earplugs
remember those quiet evenings
remove ambiguities and convert to specifics
remove specifics and convert to ambiguities
repetition is a form of change
reverse
short circuit
improve his virility shovels them straight into his lap)
shut the door and listen from outside
simple subtraction
spectrum analysis
take a break
take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance
the inconsistency principle
the tape is now the music
think of the radio
tidy up
trust in the you of now
turn it upside down
use an old idea
use an unacceptable color
use fewer notes
use more notes
use filters
use "unqualified" people
change one thing, and another will change automatically
how would someone else do it?
how would you like it to be?
what to increase? what to reduce? what to maintain?
what were the branch points in the evolution of this entity?
simple subtraction
what is the simplest solution?
go outside. shut the door.
destroy the most important thing
what is the reality of the situation?
what mistakes did you make last time?
are there sections? consider transitions.
turn it upside down
put in earplugs
what would your closest friend do?
what would your closest enemy do?
is there something missing?
listen to the quiet voice
remove specifics and convert to ambiguities
abandon normal instruments
remove ambiguities and convert to specifics
trust in the you of now
the inconsistency principle
take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance
what to maintain?
what is the simplest solution?
