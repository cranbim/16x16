# [16x16]

**[16x16]** is an interactive installation exploring computer-aided creativity through an esoteric grid-based music composition environment. Typing on a keyboard, the player explores a series of novel grid-based music environments whilst being encouraged with machine-learning generated creativity prompts. The work looks at how restrictions and minimalist interaction can foster creativity and how machine-learning can become a valuable part of the creative process. How much musical fun can you have with only 256 squares? can simple technology lead to deep interaction and flow? can you make complex music with such a simple system? and does collaboration with whimsical machine-learning aid creativity?
